- 👋 Hi, I’m @tictocteam
- 👀 I’m interested in discovering how my staff operate and maintain my company cloud.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about cloud development via Coursera IBM Full Stack Developer course.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on better ways to make things work with the cloud.
- 📫 How to reach me is simple. tim.bartlett@fachmann.com.au is best in the first instance, then we can possibly use Slack or some other method of choice.
